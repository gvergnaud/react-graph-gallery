              At its core, <b>a graph is just a bunch of shapes</b> such as
              circles, rectangles, and lines displayed on a screen. Using
              standard HTML elements to draw these shapes would be{' '}
              <b>cumbersome and limiting</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fortunately, there's a <b>more efficient solution</b>: SVG. SVG is
              a versatile and widely-used technology that allows us to draw
              shapes in the browser with precision and ease.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this module, we'll explore how SVG works and how it can be
              harnessed to create dynamic and insightful data visualizations.

            Scalable Vector Graphics (
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a>)
            is an XML-based format for vector graphics. Unlike raster graphics
            which are made up of pixels, SVG uses vector data (points, lines,
            and curves) to create images. This means SVG images are
            resolution-independent and can scale up or down without losing
            quality.

            The <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> tag is an HTML element that you can use
            directly in your React components. You can draw a variety of shapes
            using predefined SVG elements like <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code> and{' '}
            <code>&lt;rect&gt;</code>. Many of the graphs and visualizations you
            see on the web are created using SVG.

      <h2>Most simple example</h2>
      <p>Here is a very simple react app that uses SVG to render a circle:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A react component called <code>SvgCircle</code> is defined in a file
          called <code>SvgCircle.tsx</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          It renders an SVG area thank to a <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> HTML
          element. It has some <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          In this SVG area, a <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code> is drawn.{' '}
          <code>cx</code> and <code>cy</code> set the position of the circle.{' '}
          <code>r</code> its radius.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div className="full-bleed my-4 max-w-7xl mx-auto">
        <CodeSandbox vizName="SvgCircle" />
      </div>
      <p>Awesome! ðŸ”†</p>
      <p>
        With just a few more circles like this, we'll have a complete{' '}
        <Link href="/scatter-plot">scatterplot</Link>!
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Note</u>: The coordinate system of SVG starts at the top-left corner,
        where the origin point (0,0) is located.
      </p>

      <h2>You can style SVG</h2>
      <p>
        SHow that yu can add a css file and it works. But it has some
        specificity.

      </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scalability:</strong> SVG images maintain their quality at any
          size, making them ideal for responsive design. Whether viewed on a
          small mobile screen or a large desktop monitor, SVG graphics look
          crisp and clear.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interactivity:</strong> SVG elements can be styled and
          animated using CSS and JavaScript, allowing for dynamic and
          interactive graphics. This makes SVG a powerful tool for creating
          engaging data visualizations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Text within SVG is searchable and
          accessible by screen readers. This enhances the accessibility of web
          content, making it more usable for people with disabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance:</strong> SVG files are often smaller in size
          compared to raster images, especially for complex graphics. This can
          lead to faster load times and improved performance of web pages.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </h2>
      <p>
        While SVG is a powerful tool for creating high-quality, scalable
        graphics, it does have <b>performance limitations</b>, especially when
        used for data visualization.
      </p>
      <p>
        As SVG graphs are defined in the DOM, each shape or element added to an
        SVG <b>increases the number of DOM nodes</b>. For complex visualizations
        with a large number of elements, such as detailed scatterplots or large
        datasets, this can <b>make the DOM very heavy</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, <b>the browser may become slow and unresponsive</b> due to
        the increased workload of rendering and managing numerous SVG elements.
        This can lead to performance bottlenecks, particularly on devices with
        limited processing power or memory.
