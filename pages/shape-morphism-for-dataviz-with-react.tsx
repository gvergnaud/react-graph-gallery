          In the field of data visualization shape morphism is mostly usefull to
          transition between 2 chart types. It is pretty hard to implement that
          kind of smooth transition so why should we even care?

          <br />
          <li>
            Highlight the direct relationship between 2 charts. During the
            transition one can follow a specific item and understand it's the
            same.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure that we're looking at the same dataset, but represented
            differently
          </li>
        </ul>
      </AccordionSection>

      <AccordionSection title={'What are we trying to do'} startOpen={true}>
        <p>
          Sometimes in dataviz we want to transition between 2 chart types,
          let's say between a pie chart and a barplot. This is pretty hard since
          the shapes used for those 2 charts are very different: arc versus
          rectangle.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This is still possible thanks to a few libraries. This post suggests
          to use <code>d3.js</code> to build the start and end svg path,{' '}
          <code>flubber</code>
          to interpolate those path, <code>react-spring</code> for the animation
          and <code>react</code> for the rendering.

          It's very straightforward to interpolate a y between the 2 of them

          <code>interpolate()</code> returns a function. This function accepts
          only 1 argument: a value between 0 (start) and 1 (end). It will return
          the interpolated shape for this progress.
