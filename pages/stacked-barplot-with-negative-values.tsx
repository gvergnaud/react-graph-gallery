            Let's consider a company that has 3 employees: <code>a</code>,{' '}
            <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>. Each month those employees sell
            umbrellas and make money.
          </p>
          <p>
            In January, they made 1, 1 and 2 dollars respectively. It's pretty
            easy to represent those sales as a stacked barplot!
          </p>
          <p>
            There is even a bonus! The total height of those bars is 4. So is
            the value of the stack on the Y axis. We now know what's the total
            revenue of the company üéâ!

        Now let's follow the same process for the 12 months of the year. That
        makes a stacked area barplot built with <code>react</code> and{' '}
        <code>d3.js</code>. If you need explanations for the code, please refer
        to the{' '}

        or to the <Link href="barplot">barplot section</Link> of the react
        gallery.

      <p>
        That's the end of the easy part. Now, let's say that sometimes employees
        spend more money than what they make.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now have some negative values in the dataset üò≥. How can we deal with
        it?

          <p>
            To represent this on the stack, we can add all the positive values
            on top of the chart, and all the negative ones below the 0 axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is still very easy to see how much each employee made in a

            However, it is now <b>impossible</b> to know what's the company
            revenue! Indeed, the total height of the bars is <code>4</code>, the
            value on the y axis is <code>3</code>, but the real revenue is 1 + 2
            - 1 = <code>2</code>!

        Using almost the same code we can build the stacked barplot including
        those negative values. Note that when stacking the data with the{' '}
        <code>stack()</code> function of d3, the specific{' '}
        <code>stackOffsetDiverging</code> offset parameter must be passed,
        handling all the work for us (
        <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#stack-offsets">doc</a>).

          Another strategy can be applied to stack the items including negative
          values.

        <p>
          Items can be added one by one, with rectangles going up when values
          are positive and going down when values are negative.

        It's important to understand that here, the item order is important. We
        will get very different results depending on the order since not all
        groups are visible.

      <p>
        In my opinion the first option (<b>diverging</b>) makes much more sense
        than the second one (<b>overlapping</b>). The cons are very limited:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is true that the net total value is not available. But if that's
          what interests you, you don't have to split the dataset by subgroups,
          just create a line chart with a single line!
        </li>
        <li>
          Having a group flipping from top to bottom is indeed annoying.
          However, the hover effect that is included allows to quickly see what
          happens for a specific group.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <p>
        It's also important to note that most dataviz tools choosed this
        approach. Here is an example using the same dataset using the{' '}
        <a href="https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html">ggplot2</a>
        library (left) and data wrapper (right).

        Last but not least, I really like this example by <code>chartio</code>{' '}
        that fixes the non available total issue by <b>adding a line</b> on top
        of the stacked barchart to show the total:

          Chartio displays the total of each timestamp using a line chart on top
